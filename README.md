#SpeedSage Intro
qusage is published software that is slow for large runs, SpeedSage corrects for speed and efficiency at large orders
#Bottlenecking of Functions
Qusage can improve the speed of its algorithm by minimizing the cost of computaiton.

##changes calcIndividualExpressionsC
trading NA flexibility slows down qusage runs, but having the user input no NAs enforcing good input, this speeds up calcIndividualExpressionsC 2X
